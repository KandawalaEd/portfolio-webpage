# portfolio-webpage
First commit 1/04/25 at 11:20 pm.
This is my portfolio webpage for PLP hackathon 1.

I created it using purely CSS and HTML.

I only included comments at the end because I was learning while creating the webpage and having to comment and delete comments when I found better strategies became tiresome.
